I am an AI Developer at PwC AI Center of Excellence, working on Text-to-Video generation. Previously I was a Visiting Research Assistant at Queen Mary University of London, working with [Prof. Ioannis (Yiannis) Patras](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~ioannisp/). I received my MSc in Artificial Intelligence from the University of Florence in 2024. My research interests include Generative AI, Computer Vision, and Multimodal Learning. I am passionate about AI and its applications to real-world problems.
<!-- I am also a big fan of open-source software and I enjoy contributing to the community. In my free time, I like to read books, watch movies, and play video games. I am also a big fan of traveling and exploring new places. -->
